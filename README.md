## Character Controller Units 
These are superunits that give easy access to the essential controls of a game character. They are meant to speed up your prototyping process, or to make it easier for beginners to build a 3D game. Just connect it with Update or fixed update, and it should work. Basic documentation is in the unit description.

## Sort Dictionary
With this you can take a dictionary, and sort the Keys by their values in descending order. This can be useful when calculating the scoreboard in a racing game, or detecting the closest enemy to the player.

## Everything Else
The rest are just shortcuts that have no complex logic in them, which can make your Bolt graphs less messy. The "Empty Axis" units are also used in the character controllers, and allow the units to still work when no axes are set in the string field.
